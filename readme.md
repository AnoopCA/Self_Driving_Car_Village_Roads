# Self-Driving Car on Village Roads

**Project Status: In Development**

This self-driving car project focuses on navigating village roads. The project includes data loading scripts, a convolutional neural network model for training, and a test script for real-time self-driving simulation using a trained model. The model predicts steering angles based on input images, and the simulation includes a visual representation of the predicted steering angle on a virtual steering wheel.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from Sully Chen's work in the field of self-driving cars.
